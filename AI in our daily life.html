<P><i> as we all know , face ID is now avilable in all the new smart phones, face ID is one of the AI products as It lights up your face and places 30,000 invisible infrared dots on it and captures an image. It then uses machine learning algorithms to compare the scan of your face with what it has stored about your face to determine if the person trying to unlock the phone is you or not. Apple states the chance of fooling FaceID is one in a million.  </i> </p>

<P><i> Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and more, to get updated on what happened overnight. Not only is artificial intelligence working behind the scenes to personalize what you see on your feeds (because it's learned what types of posts most resonate with you based on past history), it's figuring out friend suggestions, identifying and filtering out fake news and machine learning is working to prevent cyberbullying.  </i></p>

<p><i> Search engines couldnâ€™t scan the entire internet and deliver what you want without the assistance of artificial intelligence. Those ads that seem to follow you around? , those are enabled by AI, are based on your search history and are personalized to you with the goal of getting items in front of you that the algorithms believe you will value.</i></p>
